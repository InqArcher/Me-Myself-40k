            For awhile now I have made a regualr podcast about my 40k hobby. I started doing this as something to do while I was suffering badly from mental health conditions. (If you need help with mental health please seek professional help from your doctor, otherwise
            click on the link to find out some information about mental health from the NHS.

            <br>Even though I still suffer with mental health issues, I continue to try and produce my podcast on a regualr bases! I really enjoy making my 40k podcasts as it is a hobby that I am very keen on and in recent times, something that I am very
            proud that I do.<br>

            <br> On the podcast itself I normally go through a simualr struture every podcast such as - discuss any new updates from the Warhammer company for example, new models, rule book relases etc.

            <br> I also narrate a story for a battle report I will do the following podcast and then go through the battle report, with what forces me and my oppoent used and key moments in the battle itself!

            <br> After that, I normally talk about a particular topic about 40k and sometimes I might even have a guest on my podcast and we discuss our veiws on the specific topic!

            <br> And the last (But I think the best section of my podcast), but not least is my Warhammer 40k quiz where I get my wonderful partner Amber to test her 40k knowledge on 40k miniatures!
