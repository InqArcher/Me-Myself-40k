            For awhile now I have made a regualr podcast about my 40k hobby. I started doing this as something to do while I was suffering badly from my mental health conditions. (If you need help with mental health please seek professional help from your doctor,
            otherwise click on the link and follow the information about mental health from the NHS.
            <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/?WT.tsrc=Search&WT.mc_id=MentalHealthGeneric&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtJeNBhCVARIsANJUJ2G8_ioicxZNlxgWko5PorG221F8WuqtTj3kSwLA7kpeNXki4JFcayUaAhvEEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">NHS Mental Health page</a>).
            <br>Even though I still suffer from mental health conditions, I continue to try and produce my podcast on a regular basis! I really enjoy making my 40k podcasts as Warhammmer is a hobby that I am passionate about and something that I am very
            proud that I do.<br>

            <br> On the podcast itself I normally go through a simple structure on every episode - Firstly, I discuss any news and/or updates from the Warhammer company for example, new models, rule book releases etc.

            <br> I also narrate a story time section that I normally follow with a battle report of a 40k game in the following episode. The battle report will consist of me going through the two forces me and my opponent used and crucial key moments
            in the battle itself!

            <br> After that, I talk about a particular topic in the 40k universe and sometimes I might even have a guest speaker, where we will discuss our views on the specific topic!

            <br> And the last (But I think the best section of my podcast), is my Warhammer 40k quiz where I get my wonderful partner Amber to test her 40k knowledge on 40k miniatures!

            <br> If you would like to learn more about the lore and information about the 40k universe please click the link above to go straight to my lastest episode on Spotify or click the link here!
