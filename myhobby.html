    <h2>My Hobby & a few of my miniatures</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            On this page I will show you some of my Warhammer 40k models and give a few tips on how I achieved my finished result, for those interested in painting miniatures themselves!

                    <img src="./Assets/namokhi.JPG" alt="Redemptor Dreadnought">
                    <aside> This is my Redemptor Dreadnought. I am very proud of this model as it is the biggest model I have painted so far in my hobbying career! From a painting perspective, black is a very hard colour to pull off. But the method I use is very
                        simple. I first spray my models with Chaos Black, then I paint all the black areas with Abaddon Black, as the they vary in colour. After I would put a layer of Nuln Oil, which is a black shade and make sure to use a brush to absorb
                        any excess shade that could pool in areas. Lastly, I would finish the black with a simple grey highlight on all it's edges using Eshin Grey.

                    <aside> This is the left side of my Dreadnought. As you can see I have used a lot of metal on this side. I want to bring your attention to the detail on the parchment scroll attached to his arm. To get the old, battered look of a worn and
                        stained parchment, you need to rely on the shading and hightlighting. Firslty I used a light brown/dust colour called Zandri Dust. After that a shade of a reddish/brown, Seraphim Sepia and then the hightlight was achieved by dry
                        brushing Tyrant Skull. After this was all done, I worked on the details written on the scroll. This was achieved by making a custom mix of black and the reddish/brown shade i used on the scroll itself.

            <aside>
                This is another model I have painted, my Outrider Bike. I am most pleased with how I did the hightlighting and detailing on this model. The best tip I can give here is, to make sure you match the colours you use appropriately. This is to make sure you
                match the base colour with the right hightlight colour.

                <aside>
                    As you can see this is the rear veiw of the Outrider model. Here I just want to point out the shading I did on the bikers exhausts. I used a method of layering shades to create a burnt metal affect, to give the impression that the exhausts are hot!
