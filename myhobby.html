    <h2>My Hobby & a few of my miniatures</h2>

        <p>
            On this page I will show you some of my Warhammer 40k models and give a few tips to how I achieved certain colours for those interested in painting miniatures themselves!

                    <aside>This is the right side of my Dreadnought model, note the free hand work on the right armour pauldrin. If anyone wanted to know, the chapter I chose for my dreadnought is that of the Storm Reapers!</aside>

                    <img src="./Assets/namokhi.JPG" alt="Redemptor Dreadnought">
                    <aside> This is my Redemptor Dreadnought, I am very proud of this model, as it is probably the biggest model I have painted so far in my hobbying career! From a painting perspective, black is a very hard colour to pull off. But the method
                        I use is very simple. I first spray my models with chaos black, then I paint all the black areas with abaddon black, as the they vary in colour. After I would put a layer of nuln oil, black shade and make sure to use a brush to
                        absorb any excess shade that could pool in areas. Lastly, I would finish the black with a simple grey hightlight on all its edges using eshin grey.

                    <img src="./Assets/Namokhi leftside.JPG" alt="Redemptor Dreadnought Leftside">
                    <aside> This is the left side of my dreadnought, as you can see I have used a lot of metal on this side. But to bring your attention to the detial on the parchment scroll attached to his arm. To get the old, battered look of a worn and stained
                        parchment comes done to the shading and hightlighting. Firslty I used a light brown/dust colour called zandri dust. After that a shade of a reddish/brown, seraphim sepia and then the hightlight was achieved by dry brushing tyrant
                        skull. After this was all done, I worked on the details written on the scroll. This was achieved by making a custom mix of black and the reddish/brown shade i used on the scroll itself.

            <aside>
                This is another model I have done. This is a Outrider Biker. I am most pleased with how I did the hightlighting and detailing. The best tip I can give here is, to make sure you match the colours you use appropriatly. This is to make sure you match the
                base colour with the right hightlight colour.

                <img src="Assets/DW Outrider back.JPG" alt="Deathwatch Outrider biker - Back">
                <aside>
                    As you can see this is the rear veiw of the Outrider model, here I just want to point out the shading I did on the bikers exhausts. I used a method of layering shades to create a burnt metal affect, to give the impression that the exhausts are hot!
